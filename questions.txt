10. The song titles seem to always get stuck in a loop of repeating phrases.
    "is a little girl in the world...", "you are..."

14. Most words that are input end up resulting in popular words like "you" and
    "are" which form repeating phrases

15. "shat sandwich w il mio babbino caro gianni schicchi"

16. I solved the problem of repeating phrases by cutting off the song title when
    a repeating word appears. To do this, the title is constructed as a list
    of strings. This list can be used by checking it every time a new word is
    going to be added. If the word that is going to be added is already in the
    list, then the song title is completed. Otherwise the word is added to the
    list and the process continues.

19. 1st - "bob marley me down road blues night long way you are"
    2nd - "bob marley song you are"
    3rd - "bob marley vs world is my heart"
    The title differs because there are multiple most common words to follow
    the word "marley" which are randomly selected.

20. "boogie woogie flu season witch hunt you are"

21. I like how easy it is to use regular expressions because I've needed to use
    them for other projects in other languages and they were a lot more difficult
    to get working.

22. I don't like using the end keyword instead of curly braces because they are
    easy to forget and look messy.

23. I enjoyed the lab for the most part. It was fun to make song titles at the
    end. I didn't like making the bigrams data structure because it said we could
    use any data structure but I later learned that we could only use hashes or
    the self checks wouldn't work.

24. 8 hours

25. I don't foresee myself using Ruby in the future. I might consider using it
    if I need to do some kind of data processing.
